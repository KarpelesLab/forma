//! Forma's runtime core.
//!
//! Defines the declarative [`View`] trait, the [`Element`] IR that views build,
//! and the layout + paint passes ([`render_view`]) that turn a view into a
//! [`Scene`] ready for `forma-render` to rasterize.
//!
//! # Pipeline
//!
//! `build → layout → paint`, with pointer events routed back through the laid-
//! out tree:
//! - a [`View`] (or an app build closure with a [`Cx`]) produces an [`Element`]
//!   tree, registering `on_tap` handlers in the context;
//! - [`layout`] turns it into a retained [`LayoutNode`] tree;
//! - [`paint`] draws that tree into a [`Scene`], and [`hit_test`] routes
//!   pointer taps to the registered [`Handlers`].
//!
//! Still ahead (ROADMAP.md Phase 1+): fine-grained state and tree-diff
//! reconciliation between frames (today a frame rebuilds the whole tree),
//! keyboard focus traversal, and richer gesture recognition.
