//! Stipple's platform layer.
//!
//! This is the **only** crate with per-OS code. It owns native windowing,
//! input, IME, clipboard, DPI, vsync, and surface acquisition, and exposes
//! them through a small platform-neutral vocabulary: [`Event`], [`Window`],
//! [`WindowAttributes`], and a [`ControlFlow`]-driven loop. Everything above
//! this layer (`stipple-core`, widgets, …) is free of platform `cfg`s.
//!
//! Backends live under [`backend`] and are selected by `cfg`. The
//! [`backend::headless`] backend is always available and implements the full
//! contract without touching any OS API — it powers tests and the
//! golden-image conformance suite. The native **X11** backend is pure-socket
//! and safe; native backends that require OS FFI (e.g. Win32) opt into
//! `unsafe` per-module via `#[allow(unsafe_code)]`.

// Unsafe is denied crate-wide and re-allowed only on the FFI backend modules
// that genuinely need it (the X11 and headless backends stay safe).
#![deny(unsafe_code)]
