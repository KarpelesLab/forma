//! 2D geometry primitives for the Forma UI toolkit.
//!
//! Forma works in **logical pixels** (`f64`): device-independent units that
//! the platform layer converts to physical device pixels using a
//! [`ScaleFactor`]. All layout, hit-testing, and the public widget API speak
//! logical pixels; physical pixels appear only at the `forma-platform` /
//! `forma-render` boundary (see [`PhysicalSize`]).
//!
//! This crate is a dependency-free leaf. Interop with `oxideav-core`'s
//! `Transform2D` lives in `forma-render`, at the render boundary, to keep the
//! geometry types free of any rendering dependency.
