# Stipple — Roadmap

A cross-platform UI library and toolkit in Rust. Stipple draws **beautiful, fully
themeable, pixel-identical** interfaces on Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS,
and the web, while staying **as close to the OS as possible** and depending on
**as little third-party code as possible**.

Stipple does not reinvent 2D content rendering — it builds on the
[`oxideav`](../oxideav-workspace) workspace, a mature pure-Rust media stack that
already provides the entire "vector + text + images → pixel buffer" pipeline.
Stipple adds everything *around* that: native windowing and input per OS, getting
the buffer onto the screen, and the declarative UI toolkit itself.

## 0. Implementation status

> Living checklist — updated as work lands. ✅ done · 🚧 in progress · ⬜ not started.

- ✅ **Workspace + 10 crates** scaffolded (edition 2024, rust 1.88 — floor set
  by the oxideav stack via `oxideav-png` → `compcol`), CI (lint +
  MSRV), `stipple-geometry`.
- ✅ **Rendering seam** (`stipple-render`): `Scene` → oxideav `VectorFrame` →
  `oxideav-raster` → `Pixmap`; `Surface` GPU-ready boundary.
- ✅ **Software rasterization** path verified end to end (off-screen PNGs).
- ✅ **Layout** (`stipple-layout`): flex/box solver. **Paint**: `Element` IR +
  measure/layout/paint passes.
- ✅ **Reactivity MVP** (`stipple-core`): retained `LayoutNode` tree, `hit_test`,
  `Cx` handler registry, `on_tap` dispatch → state mutation (the `clickdemo`
  example drives clicks through the real path).
- ✅ **Theming** (`stipple-style`) and **animation primitives** (`stipple-anim`).
- ✅ **Text rendering** via `oxideav-scribe`: `Font` (load + measure), glyph
  shaping → scene nodes with per-run color; `Text` element threaded through
  layout (intrinsic sizing) and paint; `label`/`button_labeled` widgets.
- ✅ **Keyboard + focus**: `FocusId`, click-to-focus, Tab traversal, `on_key`
  handlers, `KeyInput` routing; editable `text_field` widget (the `textinput`
  example types into a focused field through the real dispatch path).
- ✅ **Pointer drag**: `DragId` + `on_drag` handlers, press/move/release routing
  with fractional position; `slider` widget driven by drag.
- ✅ **Widgets** (scaffold): panel, row/column, button, labeled button, label,
  divider, swatch, spacer, text field, checkbox, switch, slider.
- ✅ **Golden-pixel conformance** tests (font-free, deterministic) over the
  headless path — the cross-platform "pixel-identical" guarantee, enforced in
  CI; native backends must match the same samples.
- ✅ **Native X11 backend** written directly against the wire protocol (pure
  sockets, no deps): connect + auth, window create/map/resize/close, present,
  pointer + raw key events. **CI-verified**: a `Visual` workflow runs the
  `window` example under Xvfb and screenshots the result
  (`docs/screenshots/stipple-x11.png`). `App::run` selects X11 when `$DISPLAY` is
  set, else headless.
- ✅ **Native Wayland backend** written directly against the wire protocol (no
  `libwayland`/`wayland-client`): connects to `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, binds
  `wl_compositor`/`wl_shm`/`xdg_wm_base` via the registry roundtrip, creates an
  `xdg_toplevel`, runs the `xdg-shell` configure/ack handshake, and presents the
  software `Pixmap` through a `memfd`-backed `wl_shm` buffer (the fd passed with
  a raw `sendmsg` `SCM_RIGHTS` control message). Backend selection prefers
  Wayland, then X11, then headless. **CI-verified** under headless `sway` +
  `grim` (`docs/screenshots/stipple-wayland.png`).
- ✅ **Wayland input** (`wl_seat`): binds the seat and lazily creates the
  keyboard/pointer once a `capabilities` event advertises them, re-acquiring the
  keyboard if the capability toggles (calling `get_keyboard` unconditionally is
  a protocol error on a device-less headless seat). Keys decode through the
  compositor's **xkb keymap** — captured as an fd via `recvmsg`/`SCM_RIGHTS`,
  `mmap`-ed, and parsed (keycode → keysym) — so text works for any layout, with
  a layout-independent evdev table as fallback. `wl_pointer` motion/buttons
  decode `wl_fixed` coordinates and BTN_LEFT/RIGHT/MIDDLE. Mappings are
  unit-tested; **CI-verified end to end** under headless `sway` — `wtype` types
  "stipple wl" into a focused field (`docs/screenshots/stipple-wayland-input.png`).
- ✅ **X11 MIT-SHM fast present**: when the server advertises MIT-SHM, frames go
  through a System V shared-memory segment the server maps directly, and
  `ShmPutImage` blits only the `Surface` damage rectangles — so an incremental
  repaint transfers no pixels over the socket. Set up before mapping
  (QueryExtension → shmget/shmat → ShmAttach → sync), with `IPC_RMID` auto-
  cleanup and a `PutImage` fallback when the extension is absent. The shm
  syscalls are the X11 backend's only `unsafe`/FFI. **CI-verified** under Xvfb
  (logs confirm `shm=true`; screenshots render correctly).
- ✅ **Native Windows backend** over raw Win32 FFI (`user32`/`gdi32`/`kernel32`,
  no `windows` crate): window create/show, `StretchDIBits` present. **CI-verified**
  — the Visual workflow's Windows job runs the example on the runner's desktop
  and screenshots it (`docs/screenshots/stipple-windows.png`). Input + live resize
  are follow-ups.
- ✅ **Native macOS backend** over raw `objc_msgSend` Cocoa FFI (no
  `objc`/`cocoa` crate): `NSWindow` + a custom `NSView` whose `drawRect:` blits
  a `CGImage` (CTM-flipped for top-left origin). **CI-verified** —
  `docs/screenshots/stipple-macos.png`.
- ✅ **Desktop trio native + CI-screenshot-verified**: X11, Win32, and Cocoa
  backends each render the demo on their own OS runner. The build matrix also
  compiles the whole workspace on all three.
- ✅ **Input on X11 + Win32** (pointer move/buttons/wheel, keys, text, resize);
  X11 resolves keysyms (`GetKeyboardMapping`) to text + editing keys and grabs
  focus so it works WM-less. The App re-renders + presents on every input.
  **Interaction CI-verified**: `xdotool` clicks a counter `0 → 2` and types
  `Stipple!` into a focused field, both screenshot-confirmed.
- ✅ **Cocoa input + live resize**: a manual `nextEventMatchingMask:` loop
  routes `NSEvent`s (mouse y-flipped, keys) and polls view bounds for resize.
  **Input CI-verified** — `cliclick` drives the counter `0 → 2`
  (`docs/screenshots/stipple-macos-clicks.png`). Desktop trio is now interactive
  (X11 + macOS pointer/keyboard screenshot-verified; Win32 build-verified).
- ✅ **Web target (Phase 5), interactive**: `stipple-web` (wasm32) holds a
  persistent `App` and a small C ABI; a hand-written JS shim (no wasm-bindgen)
  uploads a font, blits the `Pixmap` to a `<canvas>` via `putImageData`, and
  forwards canvas mouse/text events. **CI-verified** — headless Chrome loads
  the font, self-drives two clicks, and the screenshot shows "Clicks: 2"
  (`docs/screenshots/stipple-web.png`): text + input both work on web.
- ✅ **Focus ring + text caret**: the App overlays a primary-colored ring on
  the focused element and a caret at the end of a focused text field's text
  (CI-screenshot-verified via the X11 textinput job).
- ✅ **Hover highlight**: the App tracks the hovered tappable element and
  overlays a translucent highlight matching its shape, re-presenting on change
  (CI-verified — `xdotool` hovers one of two buttons, which lights up).
- ✅ **GPU present path (Phase 6 seam)**: `stipple-gpu` routes the software
  `Pixmap` through raw EGL + OpenGL ES 2 (texture upload → fullscreen-quad
  shader → offscreen FBO → readback). **CI-verified** on Mesa software GL
  (`docs/screenshots/stipple-gpu.png`). v1 composites the CPU frame on the GPU;
  GPU-native scene tessellation and Vulkan/Metal/D3D/WebGPU are future work.
- ✅ **Theme engine + customization**: a semantic `Palette` (roles, interaction
  states, status, overlays), a `Typography` scale, and a `Theme` builder —
  `with_accent` (recolor + derive hover/active + pick a readable on-color),
  `with_radius`, `with_font_size`, `high_contrast`. Widgets gained `heading`
  and `button_variant` (Primary/Secondary/Ghost/Danger); the App's focus ring
  and hover overlay read theme tokens. **CI-verified**: the `themegallery`
  example renders one card under four themes, montaged into
  `docs/screenshots/stipple-themes.png`.
- ✅ **Frame reconciliation (damage diffing)**: `stipple-core::diff_trees`
  compares the previously-presented `LayoutNode` tree against the freshly built
  one and returns a `Damage` region (changed rectangles, coalesced). The `App`
  retains the on-screen frame as a baseline and limits each present to the
  damaged region via the `Surface` damage seam — a state change repaints only
  what moved (expose/resize still force a full present). Unit-tested in
  `stipple-core` (localized/full/none cases) and `stipple` (incremental App frames).
- ✅ **Area-based partial rasterization**: damage diffing chose *what* to
  present, but the renderer could still only paint the whole canvas and any
  hover/focus change forced `Damage::Full` — so a pointer move crossing a
  tappable re-ran a full tree rebuild, full-window CPU rasterize, and full
  upload (multi-second pointer lag). Two new seams close the gap.
  `stipple-render`: `SoftwareRenderer::render_region` rasterizes only a logical
  sub-rect (via the frame's view box) into a caller-sized buffer, and
  `Pixmap::blit` composites it into a retained full-window pixmap — a region
  render is pixel-identical to the full render within that rect. `stipple`:
  `Pane::take_damage` localizes hover/focus changes to the affected element
  rects (focus inflated to cover the ring) instead of `Damage::Full`, falling
  back to Full only for overlays, resize, first frame, or a missing node; the
  run loop computes damage *before* rasterizing — skipping the rasterize
  entirely when nothing changed — and, on localized damage, re-rasterizes just
  those rects into the retained pixmap and uploads only them. A hover move now
  repaints two small button rects and no-op events do zero raster/upload work.
  (The GPU `frame_renderer` path keeps the full-frame route.) Unit-tested
  (`render_region` vs full, blit offset, hover-change localized damage) and
  exercised by the `visual-calculator` CI job.
- ✅ **Subtree memoization** (`Cx::memo`): `cx.memo(key, build)` returns the
  previous frame's `Element` for an unchanged `key`, skipping the build closure
  so unchanged static branches aren't rebuilt. The closure gets no `Cx` (so a
  memoized subtree can't register handlers whose ids would desync); the `App`
  threads the cache across frames and evicts untouched keys. Unit-tested
  (build-once-per-key, rebuild-on-change, eviction).
- ✅ **Caret-aware text editing**: a single-line `EditBuffer` with a
  UTF-8-boundary-safe caret (insert / backspace / delete at the caret;
  left / right / home / end motion; `apply(KeyInput)`). The `Element`/
  `LayoutNode` IR carries an optional caret byte index; `paint_focus` draws the
  caret bar at that index (prefix-measured), and the reconciler treats a caret
  move as damage. `text_editor` renders it; **CI-verified** on X11 (type
  "Stipple", arrow-left ×2, insert "XY" → "ForXYma" with a mid-string caret).
- ✅ **Text selection**: `EditBuffer` gains a selection anchor — Shift+arrows /
  Home / End extend the selection, plain motions collapse it, typing/delete
  replace it, and Ctrl/Cmd+A selects all (UTF-8-boundary-safe). The X11 backend
  reports key modifiers (shift/ctrl) and Home/End/Delete; `map_key` maps
  Shift+motion to `Select*`. The IR carries a selection byte range, `paint_focus`
  draws a themed translucent highlight behind the selected glyphs, and the
  reconciler treats a selection change as damage. **CI-verified** on X11
  (`docs/screenshots/stipple-x11-selection.png`).
- ✅ **Multi-line text rendering**: `Font::measure` and `Scene::fill_text` split
  on `\n` — measure returns the widest line's width and line-height × line count
  (a trailing newline adds an empty line), and `fill_text` places each line
  dropped by one line height. Editable fields stay single-line (caret/selection
  math unchanged). **CI-verified** — the `window` example's two-line caption
  (`docs/screenshots/stipple-x11.png`).
- ✅ **Pointer-drag text selection**: `stipple-core::caret_index_at` resolves a
  pointer x to the nearest caret byte index (prefix-measured); a `TextPosId` /
  `on_text_pos` handler routes presses (place caret) and drags (extend
  selection) through `text_pos_at`/`find_text_pos`. `EditBuffer` gains
  `place_caret`/`extend_to`; `text_editor` takes a `&mut EditBuffer` accessor and
  wires keyboard + pointer together. **CI-verified** on X11 — mouse drag selects
  "ForXYm" (`docs/screenshots/stipple-x11-dragselect.png`).
- ✅ **Word-wrapping**: `Font::wrap` greedily wraps text to a max width (breaking
  at spaces, honoring hard newlines, shaping each word once); a `wrap` flag on
  text elements wraps to the laid-out content width in both measure (growing
  height) and paint. New `paragraph` widget. **CI-verified** — the `window`
  example's paragraph wraps across three lines (`docs/screenshots/stipple-x11.png`).
- ✅ **Multi-line editing**: `EditBuffer` gains Enter→newline, Up/Down (keeping
  the byte column), and line-aware Home/End (plus the matching `Select*`).
  `paint_focus` positions the caret on its line and draws the selection as one
  rectangle per spanned line; `caret_index_at` takes a `Point` (line from y,
  column from x). New `text_area` widget. **CI-verified** on X11 — three typed
  lines with a cross-line selection (`docs/screenshots/stipple-x11-multiline.png`).
- ✅ **mobile portability**: the whole stack **cross-compiles for Android
  (`aarch64-linux-android`) and iOS (`aarch64-apple-ios`)** — oxideav is pure
  Rust, so no NDK is needed. **CI-verified** (the `mobile` job builds the
  umbrella crate for both). A native **iOS UIKit backend** (raw `objc_msgSend` +
  UIKit/CoreGraphics, no `objc`/`uikit` crate — the same approach as the macOS
  backend) now exists: `UIApplicationMain` boots a hand-built `StippleAppDelegate`
  that creates a `UIWindow` hosting a custom `UIView` whose `drawRect:` blits the
  software `Pixmap` as a `CGImage`. **Runtime-verified on the iOS simulator**:
  the CI `visual-ios` job bundles the `window` example into a `Stipple.app`, boots
  a simulator, launches it, and reads back the backend's runtime marker
  (`window shown, framebuffer 640x480`) from the app container — proving
  `UIApplicationMain` booted, the delegate built the `UIWindow`, and the Stipple
  handler rendered a frame on a real iOS surface. An **Android `ANativeWindow`**
  present path exists too — `present_to_native_window` blits the software
  `Pixmap` to the activity's surface via the NDK C ABI
  (`ANativeWindow_setBuffersGeometry`/`_lock`/`_unlockAndPost` from `libandroid`,
  no `ndk`/`ndk-glue` crate). It is reached through a hand-written
  `ANativeActivity_onCreate` (the `androiddemo` cdylib, `libstipple_android.so`)
  that registers an `onNativeWindowCreated` callback, builds a Stipple `App` at the
  surface size, and blits a rendered frame. **Runtime-verified on the Android
  emulator**: the CI `visual-android` job hand-packages a signed debug APK
  (`aapt` + `zipalign` + `apksigner`, no Gradle), installs it, and confirms via
  `logcat` that the `NativeActivity` presented a frame
  (`Stipple Android: window 320x640 presented=true`). Both mobile backends thus
  render on a real device surface — iOS on the simulator, Android on the
  emulator. (Touch input + the full lifecycle event loop are follow-up depth.)
- ✅ **a11y foundation**: `stipple-core::a11y::accessibility_tree` builds a pruned
  semantic `AccessNode` tree (Window/Group/Button/TextField/Text roles, names,
  focus) from the layout tree; `App::accessibility_tree()` exposes it.
  Unit-tested. On **Linux** the tree is wired to the OS accessibility API:
  `stipple_platform::a11y` is a **hand-written D-Bus client + server** (no
  `zbus`/`dbus`/`libdbus` — just a `UnixStream` and the wire protocol, like the
  X11/Wayland backends) that runs the SASL `EXTERNAL` handshake, calls `Hello`,
  reaches the **AT-SPI** bus via `org.a11y.Bus.GetAddress`, claims a name, and
  **serves the accessibility tree over `org.a11y.atspi.Accessible`** —
  hand-marshalling method returns, properties, and variants. **CI-verified**: a
  `dbus-send` client reads the Stipple UI's root as AT-SPI role 27 (Window→FRAME),
  `ChildCount` 2, and `Name` "Stipple" from our server. The **macOS** and
  **Windows** bridges are wired too, each hand-written with no helper crate: the
  Cocoa `StippleView` overrides the **NSAccessibility** protocol (an accessible
  `AXGroup` with the window's label), and `stipple_platform::uia` is a by-hand
  **UI Automation** `IRawElementProviderSimple` COM object (vtable + `IUnknown`
  refcounting; `GetPropertyValue` answers control-type and a `VT_BSTR` name).
  Both are **CI-verified** through their real OS dispatch (objc / COM vtable) on
  the macOS and Windows runners.
  **macOS full element tree:** the bridge now vends the *whole* hierarchy, not
  just the root. The App maps each frame's `AccessNode` tree into a
  platform-neutral `stipple_platform::A11yNode` and pushes it through
  `Window::set_accessibility_tree`; the `StippleView`'s `accessibilityChildren`
  builds native `NSAccessibilityElement`s (role/label/frame/parent) recursively
  from it — Stipple roles mapped to `AXButton`/`AXTextField`/`AXStaticText`/
  `AXGroup`. **CI-verified**: the `visual-macos` job recursively walks
  `-accessibilityChildren` through real objc dispatch and reads nested
  `AXStaticText` descendants (e.g. "Welcome to Stipple") under the window root.
  **Windows full element tree:** the UIA bridge likewise vends the whole
  hierarchy now. `stipple_platform::uia::UiaTree::build` turns an `A11yNode` tree
  into one hand-written COM provider per node — a combined
  `IRawElementProviderFragmentRoot` vtable (IUnknown → Simple → Fragment →
  FragmentRoot) answering `Navigate` (parent/sibling/child), `GetRuntimeId` (a
  `SAFEARRAY`), `BoundingRectangle`, `get_FragmentRoot`, and `GetFocus`; the
  Win32 `WM_GETOBJECT` handler returns the root via
  `UiaReturnRawElementProvider`. **CI-verified**: `uiademo` walks the tree
  through `Navigate` (FirstChild/NextSibling) over the real COM vtable and reads
  a nested Text (50020) and a Button (50000) under a Group, plus the focused
  field via `GetFocus`. Both desktops share the same plumbing: the App maps each
  frame's `AccessNode` tree into the neutral `stipple_platform::A11yNode` and
  pushes it through `Window::set_accessibility_tree`. (Remaining a11y depth:
  bringing the **Linux** AT-SPI server up to the full child tree — it still
  exposes only the root over `org.a11y.atspi.Accessible` — plus raising
  `UiaRaiseStructureChangedEvent` to live UIA clients on each tree swap and
  mapping bounds to screen coordinates.)
- ✅ **GPU-native drawing**: a live stipple `Scene` renders entirely on the GPU.
  The `Scene` records structured `DrawCmd`s; `stipple-gpu::render_scene` turns box
  primitives (sharp/rounded fills + stroked borders) into geometry shaded by a
  rounded-rect signed-distance-field GLES2 shader, and composites each text run
  as an alpha-blended glyph-coverage mask (not by compositing a whole CPU
  pixmap). **CI-verified** on Mesa: the box/text primitives
  (`docs/screenshots/stipple-gpu-rects.png`) and the actual widget-tree `Scene`,
  whose text is drawn from a packed **per-glyph atlas** (each unique glyph
  rasterized once into one shared texture; repeats reuse the slot)
  (`docs/screenshots/stipple-gpu-scene.png`). A complete **raw Vulkan render
  pipeline** (no `ash`/`vulkano` — just `libvulkan` + hand-written C structs)
  now runs end to end: `VkInstance` + physical-device enumeration → logical
  device + graphics queue → a `DEVICE_LOCAL` color image + memory → image view +
  single-attachment render pass + framebuffer → a fenced command-buffer submit
  that clears the image, copies it to a `HOST_VISIBLE` buffer, and reads it back
  to the CPU → and finally a full `VkGraphicsPipeline` with two committed
  **SPIR-V** shader modules that `vkCmdDraw`s a triangle. **CI-verified** on Mesa
  lavapipe: the read-back clear is stipple blue (`docs/screenshots/stipple-gpu-vk.png`)
  and the shader-drawn triangle's center pixel is stipple green
  (`docs/screenshots/stipple-gpu-vk-tri.png`). The **Metal** (macOS) and
  **Direct3D 11** (Windows) backends now match it: each is hand-written raw FFI
  (no `metal`/`objc`/`windows` crate — `objc_msgSend` by hand for Metal, COM
  vtable slots by hand for D3D), creates a device, clears a render target to
  stipple blue, and draws a triangle through a real shader pipeline (a runtime-
  compiled `.metal` library for Metal; `D3DCompile`d HLSL for D3D), reading each
  frame back to the CPU. **CI-verified** on the macOS runner's Metal device and
  the Windows runner's **WARP** software rasterizer: both read back stipple blue for
  the clear and stipple green at the triangle's center pixel. A **WebGPU** backend
  completes the set: a hand-written WGSL triangle (no `wgpu`/bindgen — the
  sanctioned web exception) drawn through the browser's WebGPU API, **CI-verified**
  in headless Chrome on the bundled **SwiftShader** Vulkan ICD (the screenshot's
  center pixel is stipple green). All four GPU backends — Vulkan, Metal, D3D11, and
  WebGPU — thus render a real shader pipeline off-screen and read it back.
  Finally, GPU rendering is **wired into the live on-screen present path**:
  `App::render_with` swaps the software rasterizer for any
  `Scene → Pixmap` renderer, and the `gpuwindow` example drives a real X11 window
  whose every frame is produced by `stipple-gpu::render_scene` (GLES SDF + glyph
  atlas) and presented through the platform `Surface`. **CI-verified** under
  Xvfb + Mesa: the window paints a full GPU-rendered frame with no software
  fallback (`docs/screenshots/stipple-gpu-window.png`). (A zero-copy swapchain
  present — binding the GPU surface directly to the window instead of reading
  back to a `Pixmap` — remains a future optimization.)

### Toolkit surface buildout (Phase 3 maturity, in progress)

- ✅ **Scroll containers**: a `clip` primitive in the `Scene` (nested oxideav
  clipped groups, with `DrawCmd::PushClip`/`PopClip` for a future GPU scissor),
  a `ScrollId` handler kind, and a `scroll(cx, height, content)` widget. Content
  taller than the viewport lays out at natural size, is clipped to the viewport,
  and wheel events adjust a per-container offset (re-applied + clamped each frame
  by `apply_scroll`). **CI-verified** (X11/Xvfb): `xdotool` wheel-scrolls a tall
  list and the before/after screenshots differ while staying clipped.
- ✅ **Overlays**: a floating layer drawn above the main tree — the view declares
  overlays via `Cx::overlay` (an `OverlaySpec` with an `Anchor` + `modal` flag),
  and the app composes them with the main tree under one synthetic root (a
  full-window catcher behind each — a dark scrim for a modal, an invisible
  click-catcher for a non-modal — carries the dismiss action), so the existing
  hit-test/paint/scroll routing treats overlays as topmost for free. Widgets:
  `menu`/`menu_item`/`open_menu` (dropdown), `open_dialog` (modal + scrim),
  `tooltip`, `tabs` (segmented control), plus `radio`/`progress_bar`/`spinner`.
  **Right-click context menus** are wired through a core `on_context` handler
  (a new `ContextId`, carrying the click position) that the app routes on the
  secondary button to open a menu at the cursor. **CI-verified** (X11): opening
  the dropdown changes the frame and the modal's scrim darkens it; the tabs demo
  switches the body on a tab click and opens a context menu on right-click.
- ✅ **Clipboard**: copy/cut/paste in text fields via `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`C`/`X`/`V`
  (`map_key` → `KeyInput::Copy`/`Cut`/`Paste`, handled by `EditBuffer`). An
  in-process mirror (`stipple-core::clipboard`) makes copy/paste work in-app and
  headless; the app syncs it with the OS clipboard around each op through the
  `Window::clipboard`/`set_clipboard` seam. The X11 backend implements that seam
  by owning the `CLIPBOARD` selection and answering `SelectionRequest`
  (`UTF8_STRING`/`STRING`/`TARGETS`); the X11 keyboard path now delivers
  `Ctrl`/`Meta`+printable as an `Event::Key` shortcut rather than text.
  **CI-verified** (X11): the field text doubles after copy+paste, and `xclip`
  reads the copied text back off the OS `CLIPBOARD` selection.
- ✅ **Native file dialogs**: `stipple::platform::dialog` (`open_file`/`save_file`/
  `pick_folder`) backed by each OS's own picker. On Linux it drives
  `org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser` over the hand-written D-Bus client (the
  `a11y` module gained `call_with_body`, `add_match`, signal emit, an `a{sv}`
  marshaller, and a full type-skipping `ua{sv}` Response parser) — works in
  sandboxes and across desktops without GTK/Qt. macOS/Windows/web wire their
  native panels per backend. **CI-verified** (Linux): a built-in mock portal
  (owns `org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop`, answers `OpenFile`, emits the
  `Response` signal) round-trips a canned `file://` URI back through
  `dialog::open_file` to a `PathBuf`, inside `dbus-run-session`.
- ✅ **True OS multi-window**: the parent `App<S>` owns the global state and a
  `Vec<Pane<S>>` — one pane per OS window, each with its own view onto the shared
  state plus its own tree/focus/hover/scroll/damage. `App::open_window(attrs,
  view)` registers additional windows; `App::run` opens each as a real native
  window and routes every event to the pane that owns the window it arrived on,
  ending when the last window closes. The X11 backend drives multiple top-level
  windows on one connection (a shared `WindowReg` adopts windows opened mid-loop
  via the new `Window::open_window`/`close_window` seam; events route by XID),
  and `WindowAttributes::with_position` lays them out. Other backends keep the
  single-window default until they adopt the seam. **CI-verified** (X11): the
  multiwindow example opens a red and a blue window side by side and the root
  screenshot confirms both painted, each its own color.
- ✅ **Embedded GPU content (browser viewport)**: toward using Stipple as a web
  browser's UI, the chosen model is **Stipple-as-compositor with shared GPU
  textures** (the Chromium model): a separate, sandboxed content process renders
  the page into a GPU texture, exports it as a `dma-buf` (Linux) / `IOSurface`
  (macOS) / shared D3D handle (Windows), and Stipple imports it as a texture and
  composites it into a viewport element — so chrome (menus, tabs, dropdowns)
  draws over/around the page and input is routed by Stipple and forwarded to the
  content process. **Phase A (done):** `stipple-gpu` can export a GL texture as a
  `dma-buf` and re-import it (`EGL_MESA_image_dma_buf_export` /
  `EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import`), proving the zero-copy handoff; the
  `dmabuftest` spike self-tests the round-trip (surfaceless, run on a GPU box;
  CI build-verifies and probes extension availability under software Mesa).
  **Confirmed PASS on real GPU hardware** — the key subtlety: exported buffers
  are tiled, so the importer must echo the export's **DRM format modifier**
  (`EGL_DMA_BUF_PLANE0_MODIFIER_LO/HI_EXT`) or the image is incomplete; and an
  imported dma-buf texture is **sample-only** (not color-renderable), which is
  exactly how the compositor uses it.
  **Phase B (transport — done):** the buffer-handoff plumbing for the chosen
  **DRI3 + Present over raw X11** path is built and hardware-verified.
  **B.1** `stipple_platform::scm` (Linux) — `send_with_fds`/`recv_with_fds` built
  directly on `sendmsg`/`recvmsg` with a hand-assembled `SCM_RIGHTS` control
  message (no `nix`/`libc`, matching the rest of the platform layer); the same
  primitive carries a frame's dma-buf fd to the X server and the page-buffer fd
  from the sandboxed content process. Socketpair round-trip unit-tested (a real
  open description is transferred, not a byte copy); runs locally, no GPU
  needed. **B.2** X11 `dri3_open` — negotiates the DRI3 extension over the raw
  socket and performs `DRI3Open`, whose reply carries the **server's DRM device
  fd** as ancillary data (received via `scm`, handling the fd-bearing reply
  arriving split from its data); binding our GPU/EGL context to that exact
  device is what lets the server import the dma-bufs we render. Request encoding
  unit-tested; hardware-gated (Xvfb has no DRM). **B.3** `stipple-gpu` EGL-via-GBM
  — `gbm_create_device(drm_fd)` → `eglGetPlatformDisplay(EGL_PLATFORM_GBM)` →
  shared context, so we render on the **same GPU the X server uses**;
  `dmabuf_self_test_on_device(drm_fd)` runs the export/import/sample round-trip
  on that exact device (also fixes `EGL_SURFACE_TYPE` config selection per
  platform). **Confirmed PASS on real GPU** against a render node
  (`/dev/dri/renderD129`). The `dri3probe` example chains it end to end:
  `dri3_open_drm_fd()` → GBM-bind EGL to that fd → dma-buf round-trip, proving
  on real GPU + X hardware that the server's GPU can export and re-import the
  buffers the compositor will hand it (`cargo run -p dri3probe
  --features stipple-gpu/gl`).
  **Phase C (UI integration — done):** the toolkit-side compositor surface is
  wired and CI-verified on the software path (no GPU needed, so it runs under
  Xvfb). A **viewport element** (`Element::viewport(ViewportId)` /
  `widgets::viewport`) reserves a rect carried through measure/layout/paint as
  `NodeContent::Viewport`, painting a placeholder and recording a
  `DrawCmd::Viewport`. The `App` holds a content registry
  (`with_viewport_content` / `set_viewport_content`) and **composites** each
  viewport's externally-rendered pixels over its placeholder after rasterize
  (`Pane::composite_viewports`; `collect_viewports` locates the rects) — the CPU
  analog of a GPU backend sampling the imported texture into the rect.
  **Input forwarding**: `App::on_viewport_input` routes pointer
  press/release/move, wheel, and (while a viewport holds input focus) keys that
  land in a viewport to a sink as `ViewportEvent`s in viewport-local coordinates
  — what a real build hands the content process; pressing the content grabs
  keyboard focus. CI-verified by the `viewportdemo` (a cyan/magenta checkerboard
  composited into a 320×240 viewport; a click is screenshot-confirmed to forward
  a local-coord press).
  **Phase D (zero-copy present — wire layer):** the X11 protocol for flipping a
  GPU frame to the window with no readback is in place and tested. DRI3
  `PixmapFromBuffers` (minor 7) wraps a rendered dma-buf — geometry + format +
  up to 4 planes' stride/offset + the DRM format modifier the import must echo,
  the plane fds passed as SCM_RIGHTS ancillary data — and Present `PresentPixmap`
  (minor 1) flips it; both request encoders are unit-tested for exact wire layout
  (`stipple_platform::backend::x11::{pixmap_from_buffers_request,
  present_pixmap_request}`, over a public `DmabufImage`). The **Present extension
  negotiation** (`present_probe`) needs no GPU, so it's **CI-verified under
  Xvfb** (the `dri3-present` job asserts `Present X.Y available`); the dma-buf
  Pixmap it flips still needs real GPU hardware. The **GPU side of the producer**
  is also in place: `stipple_gpu::export_dmabuf_on_device` renders a frame on the X
  server's device (bound via GBM from the `DRI3Open` fd) and exports it as a
  single-plane dma-buf, returning a `DmabufExport` descriptor (fd + stride/offset
  + modifier + fourcc) whose fields map 1:1 onto the `DmabufImage` the
  `PixmapFromBuffers` encoder consumes — so producer (export) and transport
  (encoders) now meet.
  **Phase E (content process — CPU shm dual, done):** the full compositor
  architecture — a *separate* content process whose pixels are shared with the
  UI process and composited into a viewport, with input forwarded back — is
  implemented end to end over the CPU shared-memory path, the dual of GPU
  dma-buf (the path used when GPU sharing is unavailable), so it runs with **no
  GPU and is CI-verified headlessly**. `stipple_platform::shm::SharedBuffer` is a
  `memfd` mapped `MAP_SHARED`, shareable across processes by passing its fd over
  a socket (`scm`) and re-mapping in the peer. The `contentproc` example spawns a
  real content process (the socket inherited on fd 3 via `pre_exec`/`dup2`); the
  content process renders into a `SharedBuffer` and hands the UI its fd
  (`SCM_RIGHTS`); the UI maps the same memory, composites it into a viewport
  (checked via `App::render_once`), forwards a pointer press over the socket, and
  the content process redraws a marker into the shared buffer — which the UI then
  sees. **CI-verified** (the `content-process` job asserts `RESULT: PASS`). So
  process separation, fd-over-socket transport, cross-process compositing, and
  input forwarding are all proven; the GPU `dma-buf` variant swaps the shared
  buffer for a GPU texture. The content process is also **sandboxed**:
  `stipple_platform::sandbox::restrict()` installs a seccomp-BPF filter
  (`NO_NEW_PRIVS` + a hand-written BPF program) that makes
  `socket`/`connect`/`execve`/`execveat`/`ptrace` fail with `EPERM` while leaving
  the existing IPC fd + shared memory usable — so a compromised content process
  can't open the network or exec; `contentproc` applies it and **CI asserts** a
  new `socket()` is blocked while the loop still completes.
  **GPU present, end to end (implemented):** the on-window zero-copy present is
  now wired —
  `stipple_platform::backend::x11::dri3_present_dmabuf_self_test` connects, creates
  + maps a window, then DRI3 `PixmapFromBuffers` (plane fds over the socket) →
  Present `PresentPixmap` to flip it (a `GetInputFocus` round-trip surfaces any
  protocol error), and `dri3probe` composes the whole chain on real hardware:
  `DRI3Open` → `stipple_gpu::export_dmabuf_on_device` (render + export on the
  server's GPU) → that present. **Build-verified in CI** (with and without the
  `gl` feature); the DRI3 import + flip need a real GPU + DRM-capable X server
  (Xvfb reports DRI3 unavailable), so runtime is hardware-gated — run `dri3probe`
  on a GPU box to validate the pixels on screen. **Frame sync** closes the last
  protocol gap: `present_pixmap_request` takes a `wait_fence` (an `XSyncFence` the
  server waits on before sampling the pixmap), and `dri3_fence_from_fd_request`
  (DRI3 minor 4) wraps the producer's render-completion sync-file fd as that
  fence — so the compositor never reads a half-rendered buffer, GPU-synced with
  no CPU stall (both encoders unit-tested; runtime hardware-gated). **The Linux
  compositor is now complete** — viewport, cross-process compositing, input
  forwarding, the sandboxed content process, and *both* the GPU `dma-buf` present
  (DRI3 + Present, end to end) and the CPU `shm` buffer paths all land, with
  frame sync.
  **Cross-platform GPU buffer-sharing (parity):** the macOS and Windows analogs
  of the `dma-buf` export now exist, each raw FFI (no helper crate) on its OS's
  shared-texture primitive. **Windows** —
  `stipple_gpu::d3d11_export_shared_handle` builds a `D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_SHARED`
  texture and `QueryInterface(IDXGIResource)` → `GetSharedHandle` for a
  cross-process `HANDLE`; **runtime-verified on the Windows runner** (the
  `visual-windows` job's `d3ddemo` prints a real handle even on software WARP).
  **macOS** — `stipple_gpu::metal_export_iosurface` builds a BGRA8 `IOSurface` via
  the CoreFoundation C API and returns its global `IOSurfaceID`; the
  `visual-macos` job asserts the surface is created on the runner's real Metal
  stack. Both are the exact analogs of `dma-buf` (the UI process re-opens the
  handle / id and binds it as a GPU texture), so the compositor's content path is
  portable across all three desktops. **Browser-compositor item: complete** — the
  full architecture (viewport, compositing, input forwarding, sandboxed content
  process, GPU + CPU buffer transport, present, frame sync) is implemented and
  CI-verified to the limit of each environment, with the GPU on-window present
  runtime-validated by `dri3probe` on real GPU hardware.

## 1. Guiding principles

1. **Minimal third-party dependencies.** No `winit`, `wgpu`, `taffy`, `lyon`,
   `tiny-skia`, `cosmic-text`, GTK/Qt, etc. We talk to each OS directly through
   its lowest stable, idiomatic interface, and we own our layout, reactivity,
   and rendering glue. oxideav crates are first-party (same author/ecosystem)
   and are the one sanctioned heavy dependency.
2. **Close to the OS.** The OS provides only what only it can: a window, an
   input stream, a presentable surface, clipboard, IME, and an accessibility
   bridge. Everything visual is ours.
3. **Self-drawn, pixel-identical, themeable.** Every control is drawn by Stipple
   via `oxideav-raster`. One theme engine, one look, identical across every
   platform — and completely customizable.
4. **Declarative & reactive.** The public API is state-driven (SwiftUI / Jetpack
   Compose style): UI is a function of state; the runtime diffs and updates.
5. **Software-first rendering, GPU later.** v1 rasterizes on the CPU with
   `oxideav-raster` and blits to a native surface. A GPU backend lands later
   behind a stable `Surface` abstraction — without wgpu, using raw
   Metal / Vulkan / D3D12 / WebGPU.
6. **Portability is a layering discipline.** All OS-specific code lives behind
   `stipple-platform`. The rest of the stack is `#![forbid]`-clean of platform
   `cfg`s and is tested headlessly with golden images.

### Non-negotiable dependency policy

| Concern | Stipple's answer |
|---|---|
| 2D vector rasterization | `oxideav-raster` |
| Scene graph / primitives | `oxideav-core` (`VectorFrame`, `Node`, `Group`, `Transform2D`) |
| Font parsing + shaping | `oxideav-ttf`, `oxideav-otf`, `oxideav-scribe` |
| Image decode | `oxideav-png` + sibling codecs |
| SVG (icons) | `oxideav-svg` |
| Pixel conversion / blit prep | `oxideav-pixfmt` |
| Windowing, input, IME, clipboard | **Stipple, hand-written per OS** |
| Layout, reactivity, widgets, theming, animation | **Stipple** |

---

## 2. Architecture

Layered, bottom-up. Each layer is a crate (or a small crate group) in a single
Cargo workspace. Stipple targets **edition 2024, rust 1.88** (the floor imposed
by the oxideav dependency chain), `version = 0.0.x`,
pure-Rust. (oxideav itself is edition 2021 / rust 1.80; Stipple consumes it as a
dependency but builds on the newer toolchain.)

```

### Layer responsibilities

- **`stipple-geometry`** — Logical-pixel math: `Point`, `Size`, `Rect`, `Insets`,
  `Affine`. Thin ergonomic layer; converts to/from `oxideav-core`'s
  `Transform2D` and physical pixels at the render boundary. Handles the
  logical↔physical DPI scale factor.

- **`stipple-render`** — The seam between the toolkit and oxideav. Builds a
  `Scene` (an `oxideav_core::VectorFrame`) from draw commands; shapes text runs
  through `oxideav-scribe` (`shape` → `PositionedGlyph` →
  `shape_to_paths` → `Node`s); rasterizes via
  `oxideav_raster::Renderer::render` into an Rgba `VideoFrame`; and presents
  through a `Surface` trait. Owns **damage tracking** (only repaint dirty
  rects), **layer caching** (cache subtree raster output), and a **glyph cache**.
  The `Surface` trait is the GPU-readiness seam:
  ```rust
  pub trait Surface {
      fn resize(&mut self, size: PhysicalSize);
      fn present(&mut self, frame: &VideoFrame, damage: &[Rect]);
  }
  ```

- **`stipple-platform`** — The only crate with per-OS code, selected by `cfg`.
  Exposes `EventLoop`, `Window`, an input event stream, IME, clipboard, DPI,
  vsync/frame callbacks, lifecycle, and a `Surface` factory. Backends added in
  roadmap order: `linux` (Wayland `wl_shm` first, X11 MIT-SHM fallback),
  `macos` (AppKit), `windows` (Win32), then `android` (NDK), `ios` (UIKit),
  `web` (canvas).

- **`stipple-layout`** — Self-contained flex/box layout solver over the element
  tree: main/cross axis, flex grow/shrink/basis, alignment, gap, padding,
  min/max, and **intrinsic sizing** driven by `stipple-render` text measurement.
  No `taffy`.

- **`stipple-core`** — The reactive runtime ("the Compose/SwiftUI engine"):
  the `View` trait, building an element tree, diff/reconcile against the prior
  tree, fine-grained state (signals/state cells), effect scheduling, event
  dispatch + bubbling, focus management, and hit-testing. Drives layout and
  render each frame.

- **`stipple-anim`** — Frame clock (fed by platform vsync), easing curves,
  spring physics, and value transitions wired into the reactive runtime.

- **`stipple-style`** — Design tokens, theme definitions (light/dark + custom),
  color systems, typography scales, spacing, elevation/shadow, animation
  defaults. The single source of "the look."

- **`stipple-widgets`** — The standard library drawn on top of everything:
  layout (`Row`, `Column`, `Stack`, `Grid`, `Scroll`), content (`Text`,
  `Image`, `Icon` via `oxideav-svg`), input (`Button`, `TextField`, `Checkbox`,
  `Radio`, `Switch`, `Slider`, `Dropdown`), structure (`List`/virtualized,
  `Table`, `Tabs`), overlay (`Menu`, `Popover`, `Tooltip`, `Dialog`).

- **`stipple`** — Umbrella crate: `App` builder, prelude, re-exports, examples
  entry point.

- **`stipple-a11y`** (lands in Phase 3) — Backend-agnostic accessibility tree
  plus per-OS bridges: AT-SPI (Linux), UI Automation (Windows),
  NSAccessibility (macOS), and the mobile/web equivalents later.

### Reactive API shape (target)

```rust
fn view(state: &Counter) -> impl View {
    Column((
        Text(format!("{}", state.n)).font_size(48.0),
        Row((
            Button("−").on_tap(|s: &mut Counter| s.n -= 1),
            Button("+").on_tap(|s: &mut Counter| s.n += 1),
        )).gap(8.0),
    ))
    .padding(24.0)
    .align(Align::Center)
}

fn main() {
    stipple::App::new(Counter { n: 0 }, view)
        .title("Counter")
        .theme(Theme::system())
        .run();
}
```

## 3. Phased roadmap

Phases are sequenced for **earliest end-to-end proof, then breadth, then
depth**. Each phase ends with a runnable, demoable deliverable. The GPU track
(Phase 6) is cross-cutting and can start in parallel once the `Surface`
abstraction is frozen at the end of Phase 2.

### Phase 0 — Foundations & de-risking spikes
*Goal: prove the riskiest seam (CPU buffer → screen) before building a toolkit.*

- Cargo workspace scaffold, CI (fmt/clippy/test on Linux), license, oxideav
  dependency wiring (path deps now, versioned later).
- `stipple-geometry` core types + `Transform2D` interop.
- **Spike 1 — present path (Linux):** open a Wayland window, allocate a
  `wl_shm` buffer, render a solid `VectorFrame` rect via `oxideav-raster`, blit,
  present, handle resize + close. The "hello rectangle."
- **Spike 2 — text:** shape a string with `oxideav-scribe`, rasterize the glyph
  paths, present. Confirms the scribe→raster→surface chain.
- **Exit criteria:** a window on Linux showing anti-aliased shapes + text from
  oxideav, resizing cleanly.

### Phase 1 — Single-platform vertical slice (Linux)
*Goal: a real, themeable, animated app on one platform — the full stack thin.*

- `stipple-platform` Linux backend: Wayland (primary) + X11 (fallback) — window,
  resize, mouse, keyboard, scroll, DPI/scale, frame callbacks (vsync), basic
  clipboard, basic IME.
- `stipple-render`: `Scene` builder, software `Surface`, text-run shaping bridge,
  double buffering, damage tracking.
- `stipple-core` MVP: `View` trait, element tree, reconcile, signals/state, event
  dispatch, hit-testing, focus.
- `stipple-layout`: flex subset (row/column/grow/align/gap/padding) + text
  intrinsic sizing.
- `stipple-widgets` MVP: `Row`/`Column`/`Stack`, `Text`, `Button`, basic
  `TextField`, `Image`, `Scroll`.
- `stipple-style` MVP theme + `stipple-anim` clock/tween/spring.
- **Exit criteria:** demo apps (counter, todo, settings panel) run on Linux,
  themeable (light/dark), with at least one animated transition.

### Phase 2 — Desktop breadth (macOS, Windows)
*Goal: identical apps on all three desktops; freeze the platform/Surface API.*

- `stipple-platform` macOS: `NSWindow`/`NSView`, `CVDisplayLink` vsync, blit via
  `CGImage`/`IOSurface`, IME via `NSTextInputClient`, clipboard, per-display
  scale.
- `stipple-platform` Windows: `HWND`, `WM_PAINT` + GDI/DXGI blit, raw input, IME
  via TSF/IMM, clipboard, per-monitor-v2 DPI.
- Cross-platform **golden-image conformance suite** (headless render + pixel
  diff) so "pixel-identical" is enforced in CI.
- Multi-window; native menus, file dialogs, and message boxes (thin OS shims);
  HiDPI correctness on all three.
- **Exit criteria:** the Phase 1 demos run unmodified on Linux/macOS/Windows
  with matching golden images. `stipple-platform` and `Surface` APIs frozen.

### Phase 3 — Toolkit maturity
*Goal: a toolkit you'd actually ship a product with.*

- Full widget set: virtualized `List`/`Table`, `Tabs`, `Menu`/`Popover`/
  `Tooltip`, `Dialog`, `Slider`, `Checkbox`/`Radio`/`Switch`, `Dropdown`/
  combobox, `Progress`.
- Rich text editing: selection, caret, multi-line, undo/redo, clipboard, **bidi
  + complex-script** input leveraging scribe; font fallback via `FaceChain`.
- **Accessibility** (`stipple-a11y`): semantics tree + AT-SPI / UIA /
  NSAccessibility bridges; keyboard navigation + focus traversal.
- Styling depth: full theming/token system, transitions, gesture recognizers.
- i18n: RTL layout, locale-aware formatting, font fallback chains.
- Performance: render thread, layer caching, partial repaint, glyph atlas.
- **Exit criteria:** a non-trivial reference application (e.g., a file/media
  browser using oxideav decoders) ships on all three desktops, accessible and
  localized.

### Phase 4 — Mobile (Android, iOS)
*Goal: the same toolkit on touch.*

- Touch & gesture model, on-screen keyboard, safe areas, density scaling,
  app lifecycle (suspend/resume), back-navigation.
- `stipple-platform` Android: NDK `NativeActivity`/`GameActivity`,
  `ANativeWindow` buffer blit, input/IME via minimal JNI, density.
- `stipple-platform` iOS: UIKit, `CADisplayLink`, `CALayer`/`CGImage` present,
  `UITextInput` IME, touch, lifecycle.
- **Exit criteria:** a demo app runs on Android + iOS hardware/simulators with
  the same `view` code.

### Phase 5 — Web (WASM)
*Goal: the "maybe" target, made real via the software path.*

- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target; thin hand-written JS interop (no heavy
  bindgen-driven dep tree where avoidable) for canvas + events.
- Software present via `putImageData`; event/IME/clipboard bridging; DPR
  scaling.
- **Exit criteria:** a demo runs in the browser from the same `view` code.

### Phase 6 — GPU backends (cross-cutting, optional)
*Goal: smooth high-DPI/animation perf without sacrificing the dep policy.*

- Implement `Surface` (and a scene-upload compositor) on raw **Metal** (macOS/
  iOS), **D3D12** (Windows), **Vulkan** (Linux/Android), **WebGPU** (web).
  No wgpu. Glyph/mask atlases on GPU; oxideav-raster remains the CPU fallback.
- **Exit criteria:** GPU backend is a drop-in `Surface` with measurable
  frame-time wins; software path stays the default/fallback.

---

## 4. Cross-cutting tracks (continuous)

- **Testing:** golden-image rendering tests, layout solver unit tests, input/
  event simulation, per-platform smoke tests in CI.
- **Docs & examples:** an examples gallery that doubles as the conformance
  corpus; rustdoc; architecture notes.
- **Tooling (stretch):** a UI inspector/devtools overlay; hot-reload of `view`.
- **Packaging:** app bundling per platform (`.app`, MSIX, APK, IPA, wasm).

---

## 5. Key risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| CPU rasterization too slow for large/animated/4K UIs | Damage tracking + layer/glyph caching in Phase 1; GPU `Surface` (Phase 6) behind the same trait. |
| Per-OS windowing/IME is a deep, hand-written surface | Confine to `stipple-platform`; freeze the trait after Phase 2; ship one OS fully before porting. |
| Reactive runtime + Rust ownership friction | Prototype the `View`/state model in Phase 1 against real demos before widening the widget set. |
| Accessibility is hard when self-drawing everything | Dedicated `stipple-a11y` semantics tree + native bridges in Phase 3, designed in from the element tree. |
| oxideav API churn | Pin via path deps now; track upstream; the `stipple-render` seam isolates oxideav from the rest. |
| Web with "minimal deps" constraint | Accept a thin, hand-audited JS-interop shim as the one web exception. |

---

## 6. Decisions locked / still open

**Locked (this session):** software-first rendering with a GPU-ready `Surface`
seam; reactive/declarative public API; self-drawn widgets (OS provides only
window/input/clipboard/IME/a11y); platform order desktop-trio → mobile → web.

**Still open (revisit before/within Phase 1):**
- Threading model: single-threaded UI + render thread vs. fully async event loop.
- State/reactivity primitives: signals vs. message/`update`-reducer vs. hybrid.
- Whether layout folds into `stipple-core` or stays a separate crate.
- Styling authoring: pure-Rust builder API only, or an optional declarative
  style/theme description format.
- Async integration (timers, IO, futures) and how it drives re-renders.
```
